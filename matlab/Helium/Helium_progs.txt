This is documentation for the Helium programs, since it's all mixed up with the hydrogen ones


*** ACTUAL PROGRAMS

P_transmit_He --- the transmission probability that a He photon will
be absorbed over some distance lambda (in physical Mpc)

sigma_He_ionization ---the photoionization cross section

initialize_Helium --- initializes parameters for He case



**** TEST PROGRAMS

test_lower_redshift_transmitted_flux ---this calculates the
transmitted flux integrand for hydrogen lyman alpha, showing that most
transmission comes from low densities 

test_filling_factor_soft---this integrates the equation
Qdot=Ndot*(1-Q) and displays the plot

test_He_transmission --- test the transmission probability over some
distance l
