%%% This tests the different definitions of bubble radii
%%% and mean free paths against one another
%%% Rcrit--- the radius at which recombinations balance emission in FHZ
%%% Rstar---the characteristic bubble radius in FHZ model without
%recombinations
%%% R_gamma ---the characteristic mean free path given by
%lambda=Gamma/emissivity, where emissivity balances recombinations
%%% R_tau ---the mean free path given by tau_eff=1, where tau_eff is
%obtained by the funny model I had and gamma is fixed by the required
%number of recombinations...
